####Cookie Cat Heat Pillow
Cookie Cat from Steven Universe! I love Cookie Cat, he's super adorable and I couldn't resist making a heat pillow to keep myself warm in winter. The cover is removable so that it's easy to wash. If you'd like to make him as a pillow instead, just create the front and back as solid panels, when you're sewing him up, leave a small gap big enough to insert stuffing, then hand sew it closed. You won't need the extra felt lining for a pillow, this is simply to give it some extra stability and structure.
